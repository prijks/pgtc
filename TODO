Things needing implementing in next version:

 * add autoconf/configure.in stuff

 * improve make install rule

 * add Ability to remove jobs

 * Option to have state of jobs saved across quits, or to have quitting
   automatically punch out all active jobs

   - need to look into what kind of signal is sent to applet on quit...

 * option to have timecard calculated only on hours entered within a
   certain period

 * check for memory leaks
