pgtc, by Pete Rijks <prijks@esgeroth.org>

pgtc is "Pete's Gnome Time Card," a simple time-tracking utility I
wrote because no other tools out there did exactly what I wanted. I
wanted a tool that I could use to keep track of the hours that I work
on certain projects, so that when it comes time to fill out a time
card, I don't have to sit down and remember exactly when I worked, but
can instead just have pgtc draw up a list of times worked that I can
copy right onto the timecard. I figured others may find this tool
useful as well, so I have released it as free software under the terms
of the GPL. Enjoy.

This software is still under development, and much improvement is
still needed in the installation area. Currently there is a makefile
with an install rule, but it is in definite need of improving. To
compile pgtc, you will need to have gnome installed. Simply type
"make" to compile pgtc. To install pgtc, make sure you have write
access to the places pgtc wants to be, then type "make install".

pgtc has been tested under Linux (Debian potato) and Solaris (2.6) 
using gnome 1.0.54 in both cases.

Any questions, comments, suggestions, etc are appreciated. Please send
